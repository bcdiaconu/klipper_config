## BLTouch offset

1. place peace of tape on the center of the bed
1. move the bltouch in a convenient postion just on top of the tape and such that when the probe is deployed it will touch the bed but still be almost fully extended
1. deploy the probe with `BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=pin_down`
1. mark the location where the probe touches the tape
1. retract the probe with `BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=reset`
1. start probing: `probe`
1. get current position by issuing `GET_POSITION`
1. note the `toolhead` coordinates
1. move the nozzle on top of the mark with `G1` command eg: `G1 F300 X118.5 Y116.5 Z1.8`; repeat move until the nozzle sits just on top of the mark made on tape
1. to be sure, get current position by issuing `GET_POSITION` and receiving
1. probe_offset_x = nozzle_x_position - probe_x_position; probe_offset_y = nozzle_y_position - probe_y_position
1. save configuration in `printer.cfg` under `[bltouch]` cathegory
1. restart firmware
